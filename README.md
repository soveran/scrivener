Scrivener
=========

Validation frontend for models.

Description
-----------

Scrivener removes the validation responsibility from models and acts as a
filter for whitelisted attributes.

A model may expose different APIs to satisfy different purposes. For example,
the set of validations for a User in a Sign up process may not be the same
as the one exposed to an Admin when editing a user profile. While you want
the User to provide an email, a password and a password confirmation, you
probably don't want the admin to mess with those attributes at all.

In a wizard, different model states ask for different validations, and a single
set of validations for the whole process is not the best solution.

Scrivener is Bureaucrat's little brother. It draws all the inspiration from it
and its features are a subset of Bureaucrat's. For a more robust and tested
solution, please [check it](https://github.com/tizoc/bureaucrat).

This library exists to satify the need of extracting Ohm's validations for
reuse in other scenarios. By doing this, all projects using Ohm::Validations
will be able to profit from extra assertions such as those provided by
[ohm-contrib](https://github.com/cyx/ohm-contrib).

Usage
-----

Using Scrivener feels very natural no matter what underlying model you are
using. As it provides its own validation and whitelisting features, you can
chose to ignore the ones that come bundled with ORMs.

This short example illustrates how to move the validation and whitelisting
responsibilities away from the model and into Scrivener:

```ruby
    # We use Sequel::Model in this example, but it applies to other ORMs such
    # as Ohm or ActiveRecord.
    class Article < Sequel::Model

      # Whitelist for mass assigned attributes.
      set_allowed_columns :title, :body, :state

      # Validations for all contexts.
      def validate
        validates_presence :title
        validates_presence :body
        validates_presence :state
      end
    end

    title = "Bartleby, the Scrivener"
    body  = "I am a rather elderly man..."

    # When using the model...
    article = Article.new(title: title, body: body)

    article.valid?            #=> false
    article.errors.on(:state) #=> ["cannot be empty"]
```

Of course, what you would do instead is declare `:title` and `:body` as allowed
columns, then assign `:state` using the attribute accessor. The reason for this
example is to show how you need to work around the fact that there's a single
declaration for allowed columns and validations, which in many cases is a great
feature and in others is a minor obstacle.

Now see what happens with Scrivener:

```ruby
    # Now the model has no validations or whitelists. It may still have schema
    # constraints, which is a good practice to enforce data integrity.
    class Article < Sequel::Model
    end

    # The attribute accessors are the only fields that will be set. If more
    # fields are sent when using mass assignment, a NoMethodError exception is
    # raised.
    #
    # Note how in this example we don't ask the name on signup.
    class Edit < Scrivener
      attr_accessor :title
      attr_accessor :body

      def validate
        assert_present :title
        assert_present :body
      end
    end

    edit = Edit.new(title: title, body: body)
    edit.valid?               #=> true

    article = Article.new(edit.attributes)
    article.save

    # And now we only ask for the status.
    class Publish < Scrivener
      attr_accessor :status

      def validate
        assert_format :status, /^(published|draft)$/
      end
    end

    publish = Publish.new(status: "published")
    publish.valid?            #=> true

    article.update_attributes(publish.attributes)

    # If we try to change other fields...
    publish = Publish.new(status: "published", title: "foo")
    #=> NoMethodError: undefined method `title=' for #<Publish...>
```

It's important to note that using Scrivener implies a greater risk than using
the model validations. Having a central repository of mass assignable
attributes and validations is more secure in most scenarios.


Assertions
-----------

Scrivener ships with some basic assertions. The following is a brief description
for each of them:

### assert

The `assert` method is used by all the other assertions. It pushes the
second parameter to the list of errors if the first parameter evaluates
to false.

``` ruby
    def assert(value, error)
       value or errors[error.first].push(error.last) && false
    end
```

### assert_present

Checks that the given field is not nil or empty. The error code for this
assertion is `:not_present`.

### assert_format

Checks that the given field matches the provided regular expression.
The error code for this assertion is `:format`.

### assert_numeric

Checks that the given field holds a number as a Fixnum or as a string
representation. The error code for this assertion is `:not_numeric`.

### assert_url

Provides a pretty general URL regular expression match. An important
point to make is that this assumes that the URL should start with
`http://` or `https://`. The error code for this assertion is
`not_url`.

### assert_email

In this current day and age, almost all web applications need to
validate an email address. This pretty much matches 99% of the emails
out there. The error code for this assertion is `not_email`.

### assert_member

Checks that a given field is contained within a set of values (i.e.
like an `ENUM`).

``` ruby
    def validate
      assert_member :state, %w{pending paid delivered}
    end
```

The error code for this assertion is `not_valid`

### assert_length

Checks that a given field's length falls under a specified range.

``` ruby
    def validate
      assert_length :username, 3..20
    end
```

The error code for this assertion is `not_in_range`.

### assert_decimal

Checks that a given field looks like a number in the human sense
of the word. Valid numbers are: 0.1, .1, 1, 1.1, 3.14159, etc.

The error code for this assertion is `not_decimal`.
